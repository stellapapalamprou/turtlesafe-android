# TurtleSafe App

## Overview
This is a project to showcase the development of a mobile app designed to assist volunteers in monitoring sea turtle nesting activity, which is essential for scientific research and the development of marine conservation actions for these endangered species. The latest technologies in mobile development were used, to ensure functionality, scalability and a user-friendly interface. This digital solution ensures data accuracy and real-time data submission which is particularly important as researchers will be able to access a cohesive source of data for aggregate analysis. As a result, this solution is expected to support conservation efforts and contribute to the protection of sea turtles and their habitat.
